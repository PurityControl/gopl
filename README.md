# The Go Programming Language Walkthrough

This repo holds my workings as I work throught the
[Go Programming Language book](http://www.gopl.io).

Most of the code will be a copy of their work.
However for the purpose of learning some examples
may be elaborated or extended.

They have a copy of their source code at this
[repo](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io)
if you want to see the original authors work
verbatim.
